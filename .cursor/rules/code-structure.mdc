# Code Structure Guidelines

## Component Organization

Components should follow these guidelines:
- Client Components should be marked with `'use client'` directive at the top
- Server Components are the default in App Router
- Component files should be named using PascalCase

## Directory Structure

For clarity and maintainability, the project should follow this structure:

```
frontend/src/
├── app/               # App Router pages and layouts
│   ├── api/           # API routes
│   ├── (routes)/      # Route groups
│   ├── layout.tsx     # Root layout
│   └── page.tsx       # Home page
├── components/        # Reusable UI components
│   ├── ui/            # Basic UI components
│   └── features/      # Feature-specific components
├── lib/               # Utility functions and shared code
├── models/            # Data models and schemas
├── hooks/             # Custom React hooks
└── styles/            # Custom style definitions
```

## File Naming Conventions

- React components: `ComponentName.tsx`
- Utility functions: `util-name.ts`
- React hooks: `useHookName.ts`
- API routes: `route.ts` within appropriate folders
